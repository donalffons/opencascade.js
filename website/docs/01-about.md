# About OpenCascade.js

*(All instructions on this site are for the upcoming `@beta` release. All information is likely to change. See [here](https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js/tree/v1.1.1) for instructions of the `v1.1.1` release.)*

OpenCascade.js is a port of the [OpenCascade](https://www.opencascade.com) CAD library to JavaScript and WebAssembly via Emscripten. That means that it allows you to create applications using the OpenCascade CAD Kernel that run in the browser, on your server or on pretty much any device that supports WebAssembly.
