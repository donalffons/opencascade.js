# OpenCascade.js To-Do's

## 1. Testing (non-breaking changes)

* Add tests + examples
  * Bottle example
  * Polygon
  * STEP loading
  * GLTF export
  * references to built-in types
  * Multithreaded tessellation, usage of Message_ProgressRange

## 2. Other

* Experiment with opencascade's built-in visualization and see if it works with Emscripten and if it's any good. Create example.
* Test with NodeJS runtime and write up some recommendations on how to use the library there.
